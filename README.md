# Prognostic Model

Prognostic Model:
Steps followed:
•	Normalize the data using Standard Scaler of scikit-learn library.
•	Divide the dataset into train set and test set using train_test_split of scikit-learn. (80% - train, 20% test)
•	Train and set the hyper-parameters of the model on the train set.
•	Test the model on the test set.

Observations:
Performance of the prognostic model is weaker than the diagnostic model due to lack of sufficient data.
