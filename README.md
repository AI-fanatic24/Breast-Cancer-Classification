# Breast-Cancer-Classification

The objective of breast cancer classification is to enhance the
accuracy, speed and efficiency of diagnosing breast cancer
and prognosing the disease. Diagnostic model focus on
identifying whether a tumor is benign or malignant through
analysis of the datasets that contain important features like
size, texture etc. Prognostic model aims to predict whether
the disease is recurring or non-recurring.

To build an effective model the data is typically
divided into train set, validation set and test set. Train
sets is used to teach the model to recognize patterns
in the data, validation set helps fine tune model
parameters and prevent overfitting or underfitting
and test set is used to evaluate the model’s
performance on unseen data.

Both the models are trained on a variety og alogrithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine(SVM) to determine which algorithm fits the best.
